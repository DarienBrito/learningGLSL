## Overview ##

Working with real time media means learning the best methods for rendering, effect generation, and image manipulation. This has quickly become the realm of the GPU, and as such learning the ins and outs of shaders is tremendously important. This code repository is my stumbling through learning GLSL in TouchDesigner - taking notes, making examples, and beating my head against these ideas until they stick.

Follow along, or look through some examples if you're hungry for the same things.

Happy Programming.

Many thanks to Vincent for his examples on the TouchDesigner forum, the example toe file you find here largely breaks in 099, but but it was invaluable when I was first trying to wrap my head around some of the pieces that GLSL materials work.

Many thanks to Mike for his continual help as I ask questions about all things GLSL. Especially his contrabution of a look at deferred lighting in TouchDesigner.
